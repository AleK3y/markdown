# Welcome
## fellow comrad :)

You shall proceed into the world of Markdown,
a **beautiful** language to take _really simple and cute notes_!

---

You can express how you feel, for example:
- If you feel __strong__ you can \*\*express it using bold\*\*!
+ or if you feel *fast* you can \_show how fast you are using italic\_
* or maybe you feel ~~crossed~~ by a weight on you and you want ​~​~to strike it trough​~​~
[//]: # (I used zero width space to escape the tildas)

But always remember :P

> ~ Ernest Hemingway

Or maybe you want to read about him in [this source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway "Don't click the other guy there :I") or in [this one instead](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002133/).

Did you know how advanced this can get?
Look, a cat! :O

Want some other interesting facts? Yay I know you do :P
- If you mistype the `ls` command with `sl` on the linux terminal you get a cool - not at all annoying - train!
- There's a fancy command that lets you gain space on your hard disk, [`sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root`](# "~ara ara~ I hope you didn't try this <3")
- This one is useful! If you want, you can type code in HTML using these tags `<code>print("hello ^^")</code>`

Honestly though I prefer the Markdown version of `<code>` :T
```javascript
console.log("Oh no! I don't like javascript.\nDon't worry, who does ;)");
```
~~~c
printf("Muuuch better :D");
~~~

This is the list of top 4 countries affected by the coronavirus T.T (as of 09/03/2020):

| Country | Cases |
| ------- | ----- |
| China   | 80.735 |
| Italy | 9.172 |
| South Korea | 7.478 |
| Iran | 7.161 |

To lower the **FATALITY** rate I reccommend following this healthy-chan list:
- [ ] Wash hands!
- [x] Take distance from people ~~who are sick~~
- [ ] Don't touch your face with your hands
- [ ] Cover your nose if you sneeze
- [x] Use the mask ~~if you suspect you're sick~~

Oh I see you are wery well behaved against this type of threat :V
Don't worry you only have _3.4%_ chance of dying ~.~

Oh.. what a sad ending!
I hope you learnt something from this useful piece of information, but if you didn't here's the catch:
